## Overview

You can render collections of R Markdown documents as a website using the `rmarkdown::render_site` function. These features are available only in the most recent version of the rmarkdown package (v0.9.6).

The RStudio IDE also includes integrated support for developing R Markdown websites. These features are available in the current [Preview Release](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/).

## Simple Example

Here's a simple example, a website that includes two pages (Home and About) and a navigation bar to switch between them:

**\_site.yml**

```
name: "my-website"
navbar:
  title: "My Website"
  left:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
```

**index.Rmd**

```
---
title: "My Website"
---

Hello, Website!
```

**about.Rmd**

```
---
title: "About This Website"
---

More about this website.
```

All you need for a minimal website is an `index.Rmd` and a `_site.yml` file. If you execute `rmarkdown::render_site()` or hit the "Build website" button in RStudio, the following happen:

1. All of the Rmd and md files in the root website directory will be rendered into HTML. Note however that markdown files beginning with â€œ_" are not rendered (this is a convention to designate files that are included by top level documents).
2. The generated HTML files and any supporting files (e.g. CSS and JavaScript) are copied into an output directory (_site by default).
3. The HTML files within the _site directory are now ready to deploy as a standalone static website.

## Deploying to gh-pages

The master branch of this repo tracks all source files and rendered output. The rendered `_site/` directory is not tracked on master, and is deployed to the `gh-pages` branch using [ghp-import](https://github.com/stephenturner/ghp-import). Commit all changes and push the repo to the master branch then run `ghp-import` on the `_site/` directory (run `ghp-import -h` to get some help).

```sh
ghp-import -p -n -m "$(date)" _site
```
